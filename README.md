🐶 About This Project

This project was part of my early front-end development practice. It demonstrates my ability to build responsive web pages using Bootstrap, structure clean HTML/CSS code, and create simple, modern UI layouts.

As I continue my Software Engineering degree at WGU, I will add more advanced projects using Python, Java, and full-stack tools.
